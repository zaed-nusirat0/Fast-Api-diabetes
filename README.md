## Diabetes Prediction API with FastAPI
This project implements a FastAPI-based API that helps in predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on input health parameters. The API uses machine learning models to analyze user data and provide a diagnosis or prediction.

Features:
Diabetes Prediction: The API predicts the likelihood of diabetes using a machine learning model trained on health data (e.g., age, blood pressure, glucose levels, etc.).
FastAPI Framework: Built using FastAPI, ensuring fast and efficient performance for real-time predictions.
Easy Integration: This API can be easily integrated into web or mobile applications for real-time diabetes prediction.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
FastAPI
Uvicorn (for serving the app)
scikit-learn (or any other ML library used for training the model)
Pydantic for data validation
